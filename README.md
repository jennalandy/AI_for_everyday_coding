# AI for Everyday Coding

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to AI tools for accelerating everyday coding tasks in computational research. Major tool categories (chat interfaces, autocomplete, and full-project AI IDEs) are reviewed and compared to illustrate when each is most helpful. Environmental considerations of AI use are also highlighted. It is designed for researchers at varying levels of coding and cluster experience and will include interactive demonstrations in RStudio and VS Code. Users will leave with concrete skills and best practices for incorporating AI into their day-to-day scientific coding workflows, including assistance with debugging, generating boilerplate, interacting with the command line, and rapidly scaffolding new projects.

- `AI_for_everyday_coding.pdf`: Slides introducing AI tools and prompting best practices
- `tutorial`: Start here after reviewing the slides!
    - `instructions.md`: step-by-step instructions for this tutorial (think of as your assignment sheet)
    - `part1.qmd`: contains sample queries and responses for Part 1 of the tutorial (though we recommend following the instructions and devising prompts on your own!).
    - `part2to5.qmd`: quarto notebook for Parts 2-5 of the tutorial
        - This includes code you should've gotten in Part 1
        - This includes comments to get you started with Parts 2-5
        - Use this side by side with `instructions.md`
- (optional) `stepwise`: This includes example notebook stages at various points in the tutorial (think of as one possible answer key)
    - `2_3_copilot.qmd`: after completing Part 2 and 3
    - `4_refactor.qmd`: after completing Part 4
    - `5_agentic`: directory created by completing Part 5 with example output files
